The goal of this course is for your effort to be spent on learning the fundamental concepts and algorithms behind machine learning in a hands-on fashion. These concepts transcend any single package. What you learn here you can use whether you write code from scratch, use any existing ML packages out there, or any that may be developed in the future."

The lab classes are focused on understanding how ML can be used in various cases studies, and the pratical assignments will dig into the details of algorithms and methods for each of the main ML areas. In the lab classes, you will not be implementing algorithms from scratch, but rather building intelligent applications that use ML. In the practical assignments, we will be implementing and comparing a wide range of algorithms. To make it easy to implement the use cases we will be covering, we are recommending a particular set of software tools, but you can successfully complete the course with other tools out there."

    "In this course, we are going to use the Python programming language to build several intelligent applications that use machine learning. Python is a simple scripting language that makes it easy to interact with data. Futhermore, Python has a wide range of packages that make it easy to get started and build applications, from the simplest ones to the most complex. Python is widely used in industry, and is becoming the de facto language for data science in industry.\n",

    "We will also use the IPython Notebook in our videos. The IPython Notebook is a simple interactive environment for programming with Python, which makes it really easy to share your results. Think about it as a combination of a Python terminal and a wiki page. Thus, you can combine code, plots and text to explain what you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At this class we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time undertanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this here (https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter Notebook (formely known as the IPython Notebook) is available here (http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/index.html)."

In programming assingments, you will be implementing many of these algorithms from scratch, having had the foundation of seeing them perform in practice on real applications.\n",

A huge goal is to familiarize ourselves with the core ML concepts that we will use during programming assignments and research project. In those, there will be much more implementation of ML algorithms, so the specific ML package becomes less important. However, in lab classes, we want to move quickly through all the use cases, and Scikit-learn will help us do just that."
